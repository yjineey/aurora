A few words about me

#intro
Hello! ðŸ˜Š

I am a front-end developer with 4 years of experience in Vue.js, Nuxt.js, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

I mainly focus on developing screens for B2B systems and find great fulfillment in creating web applications that provide users with a more enjoyable experience.

When working on projects, I strive to understand and solve problems from the user's perspective, always contemplating better outcomes with a fresh viewpoint.

I believe that greater growth can be achieved through collaboration, so I value communication with my team members.

I maintain a mindset of continuous learning and growth, acquiring various development skills and finding joy in innovating existing methods.
